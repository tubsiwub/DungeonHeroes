Step-by-step:

Cutscene Manager - class that controls the cutscene.
	
	The manager is a singleton that has static functions allowing
	for other scripts to call for a cutscene to start.

	When starting a cutscene, you give a name(string) and the manager
	pulls out the prefab'd cutscene from the resources folder and
	begins playing it.

Cutscene Prefab - a gameobject containing cameras, scripts and 
	references that make up the cutscene.

	Each cutscene has a list of cameras that will be used within
	that particular cutscene.  Each camera will contain its own
	animations which have animation events tied to them.

	These animation events contain links to the cutscene camera
	script.  The script contains references stored within regarding
	which objects are relevant to the cutscene, which camera + 
	animation to play next, etc.

	Objects will have their own animations that will play when a
	cutscene camera's animation event is triggered and these 
	animations are stored by name(string).  The manager will decipher
	how each cutscene plays out by the given name(string).

Animations - the motion of the cameras that make up the cutscenes

	Camera motion is determined by set animations that are bound to 
	the local space of the Cutscene Prefab itself.  These animations
	are fixed and set at a length that includes an automatic +5.0 seconds
	onto the end.  This allows for transitions of varying length up to 
	5.0 seconds.

	Animation events trigger right at the cutscene motion's end,
	so the transitions are defined ahead of time in the Cutscene Prefab.
